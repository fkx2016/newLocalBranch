check if swap is enabled:
sudo swapon --show

if result is empty - means no swap files
example of swap emnabled: size  used  priority
/dev/sda2/ partition 1.9g 0b -2

usually only one swap but more is possible

creating a swap file: you must have sudo privileges

usermod -aG sudo username
sudo whoami

============================================================
x) Start by creating a file which will be used for swap:

sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
If fallocate is not installed or you get an error message saying fallocate failed: Operation not supported then use the following command to create the swap file:

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576
Only the root user should be able to write and read the swap file. 

Set the correct permissions by typing:

sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
Use the mkswap utility to set up a Linux swap area on the file:

sudo mkswap /swapfile
Activate the swap file using the following command:

sudo swapon /swapfile
To make the change permanent open the /etc/fstab file:

sudo nano /etc/fstab
and paste the following line:

/etc/fstab
/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0
Copy
Verify that the swap is active by using either the swapon or the free command, as shown below:

sudo swapon --show
NAME      TYPE  SIZE   USED PRIO
/swapfile file 1024M 507.4M   -1
sudo free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           488M        158M         83M        2.3M        246M        217M
Swap:          1.0G        506M        517M
Adjusting the Swappiness Value
Swappiness is a Linux kernel property that defines how often the system will use the swap space. Swappiness can have a value between 0 and 100. A low value will make the kernel to try to avoid swapping whenever possible, while a higher value will make the kernel use the swap space more aggressively.

The default swappiness value is 60. You can check the current swappiness value by typing the following command:

cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
60
While the swappiness value of 60 is OK for most Linux systems, for production servers, you may need to set a lower value.
For example, to set the swappiness value to 10, run:

sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
To make this parameter persistent across reboots, append the following line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file:

/etc/sysctl.conf
vm.swappiness=10
Copy
The optimal swappiness value depends on your system workload and how the memory is being used. You should adjust this parameter in small increments to find an optimal value.

Removing a Swap File
To deactivate and remove the swap file, follow these steps:
Start by deactivating the swap space by typing:

sudo swapoff -v /swapfile
Next, remove the swap file entry /swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0 from the /etc/fstab file.

Finally, remove the actual swapfile file using the rm command:

sudo rm /swapfile
